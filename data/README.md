For this project, I'll be using the the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aminealibi/ufc-fights-fighters-and-events-dataset

Compared to other UFC datasets online, it's more up-to-date and also explicitly splits strikes into "Distance", "Clinch", and "Ground" which will be helpful for style discovery. It also includes a variable "Ctrl_time" which will be helpful in distinguishing Scramblers from Smotherers.

I'm primarily be using *raw_fights_detailed.csv* but will continue to look into the other included files if necessary.
